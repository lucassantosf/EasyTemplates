# EasyTemplates

My first web templates using only HTML and CSS

## Description

These were my first experiences in web development, long before I entered college. I was studying a simple technical course in T.I and dedicating my time exchanging experiences with my friends who were with me at the beginning of the years 2010. Thanks JP for the support and encouragement.

## Get Started 

I really confess that there are few templates, and the quality is not the best, but who never got a start? See their preview below:
